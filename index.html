    <h1>Gun</h1>
    <h2>How a gun works</h2>
	<p>The spark from the primer ignites the gunpowder. Gas converted from the burning powder rapidly expands in the cartridge. 
The expanding gas forces the bullet out of the cartridge and down the barrel with great speed. but in automatic guns like Ak 47s they use a gas power to either reprime the primer but a certain mechanism doesnt cause it to shoot calling it a semiautomatic gun but an automatic gun just removes the stopper causing the gun to fire and gas from the barell goes back to the firing mechanism causing the primer to keep shooting as long as the trigger is pulled 

The rifling in the barrel causes the bullet to spin as it travels out of the barrel.</p>
    <h2>How a gun kills</h2>
	<p>Bullets kill by high-energy impact that crushes tissue and bone. 
Bullets may knock down an animal or incapacitate it by breaking major bones. but usually the victim dies of blood loss or when the bullet is poisoned with feeces or something that could infect the wound causing a painful infection and a higher chance of death :)

which lead to bleeding, low oxygen caused by pneumothorax, catastrophic injury to the heart and major blood vessels, and damage to the brain or central nervous system.</p>
    <h2>How many kills caused by a gun</h2>
        <p>so far its 13900, but thats all the dshootings in america in 2023 while there is more happening in different countries and to top it all off there is also a war happening because of some bald guy getting angry at Ukraina. other than that theres also thousands caused by school shootings because some kid with pent up aggression is angry because he got bullied so instead of taking it out on the bully he go buys a m16 with a drum mag and insinidary rounds and goes to a school and shoots anyone he or she can see, the tipical american mentallity</p>
